# SkyTemple Randomizer CLI API

Documentation for version: `2.0.0`

The Randomizer can be controlled via CLI API. It supports randomizing the game but also
provides access to all the information from a ROM which is also available via 
GUI (monster names, item names, abilities, etc.).

To access it run `skytemple_randomizer cli <subcommand>` or `python -m skytemple.randomizer.main cli <subcommand>`.

The API is designed to be consumed by other applications as such optimized to be machine-readable and
the output is stable. Errors are also printed on stdout. Additional diagnostic info may be printed on stderr.

## Data Structures

### Config JSON
This part of the API is stable for each MINOR release of the randomizer. It may change with each PATCH update, however,
the Randomizer WILL then accept Config JSONs from previous versions for compatibility reasons (same MINOR version).

The Config JSON is the configuration for the Randomizer. It is also used by the CLI (can be ex- and imported) from
the settings. It has the following structure (`jq` style):

#### `.chapters.randomize`
Type: Boolean

Whether to randomize chapter titles or not. Possible titles are taken from `.chapters.text`.

#### `.chapters.text`
Type: String; Newline seperated list of Strings

List of possible chapter titles. The list is newline seperated (`\n`), however the strings themselves may also contain
escaped newlines (`\\n`).

#### `.dungeons.fixed_rooms`

If true, some fixed rooms (notably boss fights) are replaced with a random layout.

#### `.dungeons.items`
Type: Boolean

If true, items in dungeons are randomized.

#### `.dungeons.items_enabled`
Type: Array of Integers

A list of Item IDs that can be used for random items. This will also affect item randomization outside of dungeons.

#### `.current_step`
Type: Integer

Number that usually increases with each new progress. Represents the number of the current step that is being processed.

#### `.total_steps`
Type: Integer

Total number of steps before the randomization is done. `.current_step` should always be lower or equal to this number,
but this doesn't have to be the case. Use "Done JSON" to detect the end of Randomization instead!

#### `.current_step_description`
Type: String

Human-readable description of the current step.

### Done JSON
Marker to signal the end of randomization.

#### `.done`
Always true.

### ROM JSON
Base64-encoded ROM data

#### `.data`

ROM data

## Commands

### `randomize`
- Usage: `randomize [--print-result] INPUT_ROM CONFIG [OUTPUT_ROM]`
- Return format: A stream of JSON lines, where each line is "Progress JSON", "Error JSON" "Done JSON" or "ROM JSON".

Runs the randomization. Each progress update is printed as JSON in a new line. The last line are either "Error JSON" or
"Done JSON". If the last line is "Error JSON", randomization failed. If the last line is "Done JSON" it succeeded
(generally, see notes below). Additionally, "ROM JSON" will be printed very last on success and only if 
``--print-result``, see notes.

Note the following:
 - The last line before the process exists may or may not be newline terminated. 
 - In rare cases additional "Progress JSON" lines may be printed after "Error JSON", "Done JSON" or "ROM JSON", these 
   must be ignored. 
 - Do not kill the process after "Done JSON" is printed. After "Done JSON" is printed the Randomizer will save the ROM 
   file or still be pending to print "ROM JSON". Only after the process has finished with a non-zero exit code is 
   the output ROM readable if `-print-result` is not set.
 - After a "Done JSON" an "Error JSON" may still follow. This happens when the ROM failed to save to disk. No "Error JSON"
   will follow after a "ROM JSON".
 - If the `--print-result` flag is set, the very last message (on success) after "Done JSON" is "ROM JSON" and contains the 
   base64 encoded ROM on success.

- `INPUT_ROM` is the path to the input ROM file.
- `CONFIG` is the path to a "Config JSON". 
- `OUTPUT_ROM` is the path where the randomized ROM will be saved to on success. Alternatively you can omit this argument
  and set `--print-result` to instead output the result ROM.

Tip: You can run the randomization with default settings with Bash by using process substitution:

```bash
skytemple_randomizer cli randomize rom.nds <(skytemple_randomizer cli default-config rom.nds) output.nds
```

### `default-config`

relied upon with caution.

- Usage: `info-moves ROM`
- Return format on success: JSON object where keys are move IDs and values are their name. 
- Return format on error: Error JSON

Prints a mapping of move IDs and their names.

### `info-abilities`
- Usage: `info-abilities ROM`

- Return format on error: Error JSON

Prints a mapping of dungeon IDs and their names. The names are an array with two strings. The first string
is the main dungeon name, the second is the selection dungeon name.
