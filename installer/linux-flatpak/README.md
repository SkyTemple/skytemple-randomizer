# SkyTemple Randomizer Flatpak

This is built for the nightly & stable of SkyTemple Randomizer using Flatpak.
Note that the Flatpak Build environment does not have internet access and builds everything from source
to conform to Flathub's build processes.

On new releases a GitHub Action will update the files in the Flathub GitHub repo and open a PR there,
Flathub is used to distribute the stable app.

Versioned are only things which are not auto-generated. Auto generated are the source JSON files with
Pip and Cargo dependencies. Use `./generator.py nightly` to build it. Use `./generator.py stable` to generate a new
stable manifest (which can be used for the Flathub repo).
Versions are pulled from `requirements-frozen.txt` in the root of the repo for stable and from
`requirements.txt` for nightly.

To run the Makefile you need to be in a Python (3.12+) environment with the requirements from the `requirements.txt` in
this directory installed.
